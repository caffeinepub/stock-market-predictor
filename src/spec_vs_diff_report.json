  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements. REQ-14 (prediction data loading) is implemented via a new getStockPrediction query and useStockPrediction hook with proper error/loading handling. REQ-15 (expanded autocomplete) is fulfilled with 110+ NSE stocks across multiple sectors. REQ-16 (backend data structures) is satisfied through a migration file that populates predictionData with sample data for multiple stocks. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
